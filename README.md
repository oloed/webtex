WebTeX
======

WebTeX is an online TeX editor which uses Amazon's web services to compile LaTeX documents. This project began as
a hackathon project at the [Amazon Hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/Amazon-UK-Hackathon-Group/events/55182062/) in
Glasgow, but is now being taken forward with the intention to launch publicly.
